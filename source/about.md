Hi there! I'm Rajiv Nair. A soon to be tech engineer, I am passionate about both the creative and technical aspects of technology.

Right now, I am studying Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (go Orange and Blue!). Through UIUC, I have acquired an interest in Entrepreneurship, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, Web Development, Application Development, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Finance and Mathematics.

I have interned as a Software Engineer at Apple Inc., where I worked primarily with the core Operating System that powers Macs and iPhones. The most important thing that I learned from the brilliant folks that I worked with is that making great products takes painstaking effort and a zero tolerance for compromises.

I am fortunate enough that my profession and passion are both aligned in technology. Outside of the tech world though, I often find myself reading books, grooving to classic rock music, playing sports such as Soccer, Tennis and Volleyball. I also enjoy a good adventure, and have dabbled in Surfing, Hiking and other such activities. Honestly, I can't wait to get to the Bay Area and start exploring!
