Mentored a small group of students in completing an open source project in
FreeBSD. The goal of the project was to design and implement a memory
compression policy for page swaps so more space can be created without the need
to swap out pages to disk. This was an exploratory course,
and my role as a mentor was also to assess the feasibility of having an open
source project based course, understand challenges associated with it,
and recommend solutions.
