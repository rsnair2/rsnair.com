title:  Priority Queue using Fibonacci heap
tags: C++, Data Structures
---
Implemented a priority queue using a fibonacci heap. The priority queue using a
fibonacci heap has O(1) insert operation and O(log n) pop operation.
In contrast, a priority queue using a binary heap will have O(log n) insert and
pop operations.
