Created a module that will choose n equities from the given m (where m >= n)
and choose the optimum allocations for the n equities whilst optimizing for the
sharpe ratio. The analysis is based on historical data from Yahoo Finance and
is used to compute the portfolio that would have maximized the sharpe ratio in
the specified period of time. Note: used gradient descent here to find the
optimum solution.
